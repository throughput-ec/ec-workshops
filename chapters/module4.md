<exercise id="2" title="Trivia Time!">

A Binder allows us to:

<choice id="1">
<opt text="Reproduce the environment we are working with and allow others to run our Jupyter Notebooks or R scripts."  correct="true">

Good job!

</opt>

<opt text="Deploy code and text and allow others to run our code." correct = "true">

This is also correct!

</opt>

<opt text="Run code without caring about the dependencies">

This is not correct. A Binder needs a file where you specify which dependencies you need.

</opt>
</choice>

True or False? 

<choice id="2">
<opt text= "You can only host your Binders on the Binder Hub" >
 
This is not correct. There are several Binder Hubs! Pangeo is one of them!

</opt>

<opt text="You can run RMarkdowns or ShinyR applications in a Binder" correct="true">

That's correct! We will use Jupyter's power to run R!

</opt>
