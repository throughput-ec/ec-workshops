This might be a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n- Configuration files for your environment. This ensures that your code is reproducible.\n\n---\n\nYou will be working simultaneously with the Binder notebook and these slides.\n\nYou can find the  <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD\" target=\"_blank\">Binder</a>.\n\nClick on the previous link, the Binder will be launched.

Here is the [link]('https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD').\n\n- Under Notebooks, select R.\n- This will create a new untitled notebook\n  - Note the .ipynb extension (comes from \"interactive Python notebook\", the previous name before it was changed to Jupyter to reflect multi-language support)\n  - Rename the notebook to \"workshop.ipynb\"\n\n- Notebooks usually auto-save periodically, since we are in a Binder, all your new content will be lost once the Binder is closed.\n- You can download your notebooks by clicking on File -> Download\n---\n\n## Working with Notebooks\n\nA notebook consists of a series of \"cells\":\n- **Code cells**: execute snippets of code and display the output\n- **Markdown cells**: formatted text, equations, images, and more\n\nBy default, a new cell is always a code cell.\n\n---\n\n## Code Cells\n\nTo run a code cell, click in it and press `Shift-Enter` or press the Run button on the toolbar\n\nThis is an example of a Code Cell\n\n```r\n# Print something\nprint(\"Hello world\", quote = FALSE)\n```\n\n```out\nHello world\n```\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Cells\n\nIn Markdown cells, you can write plain text or add formatting and other elements with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). These include headers, **bold text**, *italic text*, hyperlinks, equations $A=\\pi r^2$, inline code `print('Hello world!')`, bulleted lists, and more.\n\n\nThis is a markdown cell:\n```\nHello~!\n```\n---\n\n\n- To create a Markdown cell, select an empty cell and change the cell type from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\" in the dropdown menu on the toolbar\n- To run a Markdown cell, press `Shift-Enter` or the Run button on the toolbar\n- To edit a Markdown cell, you need to double-click inside it\n\n---\n\n## Other Notebook Basics\n\n- Organizating cells &mdash; insert, delete, cut/copy/paste, move up/down, split, merge\n- Running all cells or selected cell(s)\n- Restarting and interrupting the kernel\n- Caveat: Notebooks are nonlinear and running cells out of order can sometimes lead to unexpected results\n  - It's good practice to periodically restart the kernel and run all cells, making sure that everything works as expected when you run the whole notebook from top to bottom\n- Closing vs. shutting down a notebook &mdash; kernel process in background\n- Re-opening a notebook after shutdown\n  - All the code output is maintained from the previous kernel session\n- Clear output of all cells or selected cell(s)\n\n---\n\n# Let's practice!\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter1_03_creating_a_notebook"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 0<br>Learning Outcomes</h1></div>\n\n---\n\nBy the end of this module, you should:\n\n1.
