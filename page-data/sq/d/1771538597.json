It's made possible by a long and fruitful collaboration and possible thanks to NSF and EarthCube. Contributions and comments on how to improve the course are welcome! Please <a href='https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/issues'>file an issue</a>.","bio":"For nearly a decade, the EarthCube community has been transforming the conduct of geosciences research by developing and maintaining a well-connected and facile environment that improves access, sharing, visualization, and analysis of data and related resources. While sharable tools, methods, and cyberinfrastructure have been critical achievements for EarthCube, we find that our dedicated community is what makes our program successful.","showProfileImage":true,"footerLinks":[{"text":"Website","url":"https://www.earthcube.org/"},{"text":"Source","url":"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops"},{"text":"Built with â™¥","url":"https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r"}]}}}}
