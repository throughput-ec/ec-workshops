This might be a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n- Configuration files for your environment. This ensures that your code is reproducible.\n\n---\n\nYou will be working simultaneously with the Binder notebook and these slides.\n\nYou can find the  <a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD\" target=\"_blank\">Binder</a>.\n\nClick on the previous link, the Binder will be launched.

Here is the [link]('https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/throughput-ec/ec-binder/HEAD').\n\n- Under Notebooks, select R.\n- This will create a new untitled notebook\n  - Note the .ipynb extension (comes from \"interactive Python notebook\", the previous name before it was changed to Jupyter to reflect multi-language support)\n  - Rename the notebook to \"workshop.ipynb\"\n\n- Notebooks usually auto-save periodically, since we are in a Binder, all your new content will be lost once the Binder is closed.\n- You can download your notebooks by clicking on File -> Download\n---\n\n## Working with Notebooks\n\nA notebook consists of a series of \"cells\":\n- **Code cells**: execute snippets of code and display the output\n- **Markdown cells**: formatted text, equations, images, and more\n\nBy default, a new cell is always a code cell.\n\n---\n\n## Code Cells\n\nTo run a code cell, click in it and press `Shift-Enter` or press the Run button on the toolbar\n\nThis is an example of a Code Cell\n\n```r\n# Print something\nprint(\"Hello world\", quote = FALSE)\n```\n\n```out\nHello world\n```\n\n---\n\n## Markdown Cells\n\nIn Markdown cells, you can write plain text or add formatting and other elements with [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). These include headers, **bold text**, *italic text*, hyperlinks, equations $A=\\pi r^2$, inline code `print('Hello world!')`, bulleted lists, and more.\n\n\nThis is a markdown cell:\n```\nHello~!\n```\n---\n\n\n- To create a Markdown cell, select an empty cell and change the cell type from \"Code\" to \"Markdown\" in the dropdown menu on the toolbar\n- To run a Markdown cell, press `Shift-Enter` or the Run button on the toolbar\n- To edit a Markdown cell, you need to double-click inside it\n\n---\n\n## Other Notebook Basics\n\n- Organizating cells &mdash; insert, delete, cut/copy/paste, move up/down, split, merge\n- Running all cells or selected cell(s)\n- Restarting and interrupting the kernel\n- Caveat: Notebooks are nonlinear and running cells out of order can sometimes lead to unexpected results\n  - It's good practice to periodically restart the kernel and run all cells, making sure that everything works as expected when you run the whole notebook from top to bottom\n- Closing vs. shutting down a notebook &mdash; kernel process in background\n- Re-opening a notebook after shutdown\n  - All the code output is maintained from the previous kernel session\n- Clear output of all cells or selected cell(s)\n\n---\n\n# Let's practice!\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter1_03_creating_a_notebook"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 0<br>Introduction to Jupyter</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n# What is Jupyter?\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.\n\nThe name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. \n\nFor this workshop, we will be using R via [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html)\n\n---\n\nNotebooks are a great tool for exploration and for documenting your workflow.\nNotebooks allow you to write:\n- Code\n- Plots\n- Formatted text\n- Latex text for equations\n\nand much more in a single document!\n\n---\n\n- R is the programming language that runs computations.\n\n- Jupyter is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding convenient features and tools.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/Jupyter_logo.svg/1200px-Jupyter_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"jupyter logo\" align=\"left\" width=\"25%\" >\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/R_logo.svg/1920px-R_logo.svg.png\" alt=\"R logo\" width=\"25%\" align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\nYou can think of Jupyter Notebooks as the dashboard of a car.\n\nYou don’t drive a car by interacting with the engine but rather by interacting with the car’s dashboard.\n\nIn the same way, rather than interacting with R directly, we will be using the Jupyter's interface.\n\nJupyter will allow us to:\n- Run R code interactively\n- Use other languages such as Python, Julia, or Matlab!\n\n---\n\nThis is what a Jupyter Notebook looks like:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/01_jupyter_notebook.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Jupyter Notebook shot\" width=75% align=\"center\">\n\n---\n\n- Notebooks are great for exploration and for documenting your workflow\n- There are many options for sharing notebooks in human readable format:\n  - Share online with [nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)\n  - Github renders automatically any notebooks that you push.\n  - You can convert to HTML, PDF, etc. with [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n---\n\n# Let's practice!\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter1_01_introduction"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n<div><h1><img src=\"https://github.com/throughput-ec/ec-workshops/blob/main/static/module1/00_ec_slide1.png?raw=true\" alt=\"EC Theme\" width=25% align=\"left\"/> Lesson 1<br>Introduction to Binder</h1></div>\n\n---\n\n# What is Binder?\n\nA Binder (or Binder-ready repository) is a code repository that contains:\n\n* Code that you’d like people to run, for example a Jupyter Notebook or an R script to make a visualization.\n\n* Configuration files for your environment.
